## Throughput Benchmarking

These benchmarks are for the Q4_0 quantisations [neutts-air-Q4_0](https://huggingface.co/neuphonic/neutts-air-q4-gguf) and [neutts-nano-Q4_0](https://huggingface.co/neuphonic/neutts-nano-q4-gguf). Note that all models in the NeuTTS-Nano Multilingual Collection have an identical architecture, so these results should apply for any Q4_0 model in the collection.

CPU benchmarking used [llama-bench](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/llama-bench) (from llama.cpp) to measure prefill and decode throughput at multiple context sizes. For the GPU benchmark (RTX 4090), we leverage vLLM to maximise throughput, using the [vLLM benchmark](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/cli/bench/throughput/).

We include benchmarks on four devices: Galaxy A25 5G, AMD Ryzen 9HX 370, iMac M4 16GB, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090.


|  | NeuTTS-Air | NeuTTS-Nano |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Galaxy A25 5G (CPU only)** | 20 tokens/s | 45 tokens/s|
| **AMD Ryzen 9 HX 370 (CPU only)** | 119 tokens/s | 221 tokens/s |
| **iMAc M4 16 GB (CPU only)** | 111 tokens/s | 195 tokens/s |
| **RTX 4090** | 16194 tokens/s | 19268 tokens/s |


> [!NOTE]
>  llama-bench used 14 threads for prefill and 16 threads for decode (as configured in the benchmark run) on AMD Ryzen 9HX 370 and iMac M4 16GB, and 6 threads for each on the Galaxy A25 5G. The tokens/s reported are when having 500 prefill tokens and generating 250 output tokens.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that these benchmarks only include the Speech Language Model and do not include the Codec which is needed for a full audio generation pipeline.

## Get Started with NeuTTS

> [!NOTE]
> We have added a [streaming example](examples/basic_streaming_example.py) using the `llama-cpp-python` library as well as a [finetuning script](examples/finetune.py). For finetuning, please refer to the [finetune guide](TRAINING.md) for more details.

1. **Install NeuTTS**
   ```bash
   pip install neutts
   ```

   Or for a local editable install, clone this repository and run in the base folder:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Alternatively to install all dependencies, including `onnxruntime` and `llama-cpp-python` (equivalent to steps 3 and 4 below):

   ```bash
   pip install neutts[all]
   ```

   or for an editable install:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[all]
   ```

2. **(Optional) Install `llama-cpp-python` to use `.gguf` models.**

   To use any of the GGUF backbones (e.g., in basic_streaming_example.py) you need to install the llama-cpp-python package.

   For the best performance, you must compile this package from source with hardware acceleration enabled for your specific operating system and target device (CPU or GPU).

   #### macOS (Apple Silicon)

   For M-series Macs, it is highly recommended to use Apple's native Accelerate framework for optimized CPU performance:

   ```bash
      CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_METAL=OFF -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=Apple" pip install "neutts[llama]" --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir
      ```

   #### Linux (OpenBLAS)
   For Linux, you can accelerate CPU performance using OpenBLAS.

   *Prerequisite: Ensure you have OpenBLAS installed on your system (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev` on Ubuntu). For other distros, refer to the [OpenBLAS Installation Guide](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/docs/install.md).*

   ```bash
      CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS" pip install "neutts[llama]" --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir
   ```

   #### Windows (OpenBLAS)

      *Prerequisite: Ensure you have OpenBLAS installed on your system. Please refer to the [OpenBLAS Installation Guide](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/docs/install.md).*

   For Windows users utilizing PowerShell, set the environment variable and run the install command like this:
   ```pwsh
      $env:CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS"; pip install "neutts[llama]" --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir
   ```

   #### Looking for GPU Support?
   If you have a dedicated GPU (Nvidia/CUDA, AMD/ROCm, M-Series Mac/Metal) and want to utilize it instead of the CPU, the CMAKE flags will be different.Please refer to the official [llama-cpp-python documentation](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/blob/main/README.md) for the exact flags required for your specific hardware.

3. **(Optional) Install `onnxruntime` to use the `.onnx` decoder.**
   ```bash
   pip install "neutts[onnx]"
   ```

## Examples

To get started with the example scripts, clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts.git
   cd neutts
   ```

Several examples are available, including a Jupyter notebook in the `examples` folder.

### Basic Example
Run the basic example script to synthesize speech:

```bash
python -m examples.basic_example \
  --input_text "My name is Andy. I'm 25 and I just moved to London. The underground is pretty confusing, but it gets me around in no time at all." \
  --ref_audio samples/jo.wav \
  --ref_text samples/jo.txt
```

To specify a particular model repo for the backbone or codec, add the `--backbone` and `--codec` arguments. Available backbones are listed in [NeuTTS-Air](https://huggingface.co/collections/neuphonic/neutts-air) and [NeuTTS-Nano Multilingual Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/neuphonic/neutts-nano-multilingual-collection) huggingface collections.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using a non-English backbone, it is highly recommended to use a same-language reference for best performance. See the 'example reference files' section below to select an appropriate example reference.

### One-Code Block Usage

```python
from neutts import NeuTTS
import soundfile as sf

tts = NeuTTS(
   backbone_repo="neuphonic/neutts-nano", # or 'neuphonic/neutts-nano-q4-gguf' with llama-cpp-python installed
   backbone_device="cpu",
   codec_repo="neuphonic/neucodec",
   codec_device="cpu"
)
input_text = "My name is Andy. I'm 25 and I just moved to London. The underground is pretty confusing, but it gets me around in no time at all."

ref_text = "samples/jo.txt"
ref_audio_path = "samples/jo.wav"

ref_text = open(ref_text, "r").read().strip()
ref_codes = tts.encode_reference(ref_audio_path)

wav = tts.infer(input_text, ref_codes, ref_text)
sf.write("test.wav", wav, 24000)
```

### Streaming

Speech can also be synthesised in _streaming mode_, where audio is generated in chunks and plays as generated. Note that this requires pyaudio to be installed. To do this, run:

```bash
python -m examples.basic_streaming_example \
  --input_text "My name is Andy. I'm 25 and I just moved to London. The underground is pretty confusing, but it gets me around in no time at all." \
  --ref_codes samples/jo.pt \
  --ref_text samples/jo.txt
```

Again, a particular model repo can be specified with the `--backbone` argument - note that for streaming the model must be in GGUF format.

### Emotional TTS (NeuTTS-2E)

NeuTTS-2E is a fixed-speaker emotional English model. Pre-encoded references for its four speakers (`emily`, `paul`, `sophie`, `steven`) live in `samples/` in the same format as every other reference, so no reference audio is needed — and they work as ordinary cloning references for the other models too. Supported emotions are `angry`, `disgusted`, `fearful`, `happy`, `neutral`, `sad` and `surprised`.

```python
from neutts import NeuTTS2E
import soundfile as sf

tts = NeuTTS2E()
wav = tts.infer("I can't believe it's finally here!", speaker="emily", emotion="happy")
sf.write("test.wav", wav, 24000)
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
python -m examples.basic_example_emotions \
  --input_text "I can't believe it's finally here!" \
  --speaker emily \
  --emotion happy
```

Streaming works the same way via `examples.basic_streaming_example_emotions`, which uses the GGUF backbones (`neuphonic/neutts-2e-q8-gguf` by default, or `neuphonic/neutts-2e-q4-gguf` via `--backbone`). Pass `seed` to `NeuTTS2E` (or `--seed` to the examples) for reproducible generation.

## Preparing References for Cloning

NeuTTS requires two inputs:

1. A reference audio sample (`.wav` file)
2. A text string

The model then synthesises the text as speech in the style of the reference audio. This is what enables NeuTTS models' instant voice cloning capability.

### Example Reference Files

You can find some ready-to-use references in the `samples` folder:

- English:
   - `dave.wav`
   - `jo.wav`
   - `emily.wav`, `paul.wav`, `sophie.wav`, `steven.wav` (the NeuTTS-2E speakers)
- Spanish:
   - `mateo.wav`
- German:
   - `greta.wav`
- French:
   - `juliette.wav`

### Guidelines for Best Results

For optimal performance, reference audio samples should be:

1. **Mono channel**
2. **16-44 kHz sample rate**
3. **3–15 seconds in length**
4. **Saved as a `.wav` file**
5. **Clean** — minimal to no background noise
6. **Natural, continuous speech** — like a monologue or conversation, with few pauses, so the model can capture tone effectively

## Guidelines for minimizing Latency

For optimal performance on-device:

1. Use the GGUF model backbones
2. Pre-encode references (see `examples/encode_reference.py` or `examples/basic_example.py`)
3. Use the [onnx codec decoder](https://huggingface.co/neuphonic/neucodec-onnx-decoder)

Take a look at this example in the [examples README](examples/README.md###minimal-latency-example) to get started.

## Responsibility

Every audio file generated by NeuTTS includes by default  a [Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermark](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth).

Note: If you install neutts using `uv sync` within the repo, the program will still run, but watermarking will be disabled (you will see warning that perth is missing). This is because `uv sync` currently fails to pull the required Perth dependencies, please see [This Issue](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Perth/). To ensure watermarking is active, please install the package via PyPI instead (`pip install neutts`).

## Disclaimer

Don't use this model to do bad things… please.
